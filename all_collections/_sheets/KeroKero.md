## Equipment

- Rapier: (to Hit +9, dmg: 1d8+4)

---

## Features and Traits

- **Languages**: Dwarf
- **Ability Score**: (+2 Dex, +1 Wis)
- **Ability Score Improvement**: (Chef Feat +1 Con, +1 Wis +1 Con, +2 Cha, +2 Wisdom)
- **By Popular Demand**: You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.
- **Expert Duplication**: When you copy writing or craftwork produced by yourself or someone else, you have advantage on any ability checks you make to produce an exact duplicate.
- **Kenku Recall**: (prof Deception Survival) When you make an ability check using any skill in which you have proficiency, you can give yourself advantage on the check before rolling the d20 (Charger =  Proficiency, Recharge on Long Rest)
- **Mimicry** You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 8 + proficiency + Charisma.
- **Bardic Inspiration** d10, recover on short or long rest
- **Jack of all Trades** half proficiency for rolls without proficiency
- **Song of Rest** 1d12
- **Bonus Prof** Gaming Set, Thieves Tools, Skill
- **Wanderer's Lore**: When a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die granted by you, they may make a single Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check with advantage. The creature may choose whether or not to add the Bardic Inspiration die to this roll.
- **Expertise**(4)
- **Countercharm**: As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
- **Favorite Trick**: (Woodland Spirit, Armed Combat Lessons)

## Tricks

- **Traveler's Tricks** (4): Traveler's Tricks represent skills, techniques, and useful pieces of knowledge picked up along the way. Each one requires you to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, and takes a bonus action to use unless otherwise specified.
  - **Armed Combat Lessons** Fighting Style: Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. When you make a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, adding your Bardic Inspiration die to the attack or damage roll. When you do this, you gain the benefits of your chosen Fighting Style for 10 minutes.
    - Once, while your Fighting Style is active, you may attack twice, instead of once, when taking the Attack action on your turn.
    - You gain +1 to your AC for the effect's duration.
  - **Boxing Lessons** When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to quickly execute two unarmed strikes against one or more creatures you could target. You may use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of these unarmed strikes. The damage die used for these unarmed strikes is the same as your Bardic Inspiration die.
    - You do not provoke attacks of opportunity this turn.
    - When you hit with one of these attacks you may attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
  - **Hunting Lessons** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to target one creature you can see within 90 feet of you as your quarry. For as long as you concentrate on this ability, up to 1 hour, all weapon attacks you make against the target deal additional damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.
    -  For the duration of the effect, you are aware of your target's approximate distance and direction from you, so long as you are on the same plane.
    - you can maintain this effect for up to 24 hours.
  - **Conjure Woodland Spirit** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as an action to conjure a forest guardian spirit in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The guardian spirit is Large, and takes the appearance of a spectral predatory cat. Any enemy that moves into or leaves a space adjacent to the guardian spirit must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking magical slashing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die on a failure. The guardian spirit will remain for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.
  -  Any creature dealt damage by your guardian spirit has their speed reduced to 0 for the rest of the turn.
  - Any Large or smaller creature who has their speed reduced to 0 by the guardian spirit is restrained for as long as you maintain your concentration, as your guardian spirit pins them in place. The target can break free by spending an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Traveler's Trick save DC.
