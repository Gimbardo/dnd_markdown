## Background

Created from an experiment that failed, and thrown away as a failure, O'Birgam wandered through Asteros for a long time. From Gline to Elyvelune, never entering a city, and always just roaming around. In some woods, trying to follow his flying monkey Skydd, he fell in a portal, that lead him to the shadowfell. Here, he met Jonirenicus, that took him as his apprentice, teaching him Necromancy. After reaching some experience, he enter The Order of Icarus, and started helping them with some tasks.

## Description

O'Birgam is a pale "human", with green eyes and black medium-length hair. He always wears a long black tunic. In a giant pocket he keeps his spellbook, and inside the right sleeve he keeps his wand. With a costant "i don't know" look, he may stop listening you while you are talking to him. He has a giant scar on his back, probably caused by the experiments they did on him. He is always followed by Skydd: his flying monkey pet. Skydd always helps Birgam staying away from danger, using his higher perception to alert him.
